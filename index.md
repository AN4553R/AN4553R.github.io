I'm a SDE living in Egypt. Got BSCS degree from Assiut University - June 2019. I'm into Computer Science and Software Engineering so you can find me between theory and industry. I've started my SDE journey by joining [DigiZilla LLC](digizilla.net) (Dec 2019 - present) as a Python developer mainly in Odoo ERP systems development.
